## Overview

The Huge Real Calculator is a software application for performing arithmetic operations on numbers in arbitrary bases up to base 36. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparison (greater than/less than) operations. This project has been developed using Visual Studio IDE and is available on GitHub.

## Features

- **Addition**: Add numbers in bases up to 36.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract numbers in bases up to 36.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply numbers in bases up to 36.
- **Comparison**: Check if one number is greater than or less than another in bases up to 36.
- **Custom Base Support**: Handles bases from 2 to 36, including base-16 and other bases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio IDE (or any compatible C++ compiler)
- Basic understanding of number systems and bases

## Requirements
- User has the facility to work in any base upto 36.
- The only requirement is that make sure input.txt file is according to that base. Otherwise you will not proceed furthur.

## Input Method
- The programm will read numbers from input.txt file in the very beginning.
- Make sure input.txt file is according to the base you selected.
